# Q - Gen
A simple quote generator built using React. This project is part of my project-based React learning plan. I applied just-in-time learning, meaning no following along tutorial and only goes to learn something when I need to. I heavily rely on the React's documentation, and some articles found online.

## Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start dev server at localhost:3000
yarn start

# Build for production
yarn build
```
